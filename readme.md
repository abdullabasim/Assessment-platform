# Assessment Platform

The Assessment Platform is a PHP Laravel application designed for conducting assessments in three different sections. The platform provides a comprehensive assessment experience with multiple difficulty levels for each section.

## Sections

1. **English Section**: This section includes listening, writing, reading, and grammar assessments. Each assessment has three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. The assessments in this section support text answers and multiple-choice questions.

2. **Personality Section**: The personality section evaluates candidates based on predefined criteria. Similar to the English section, this section also offers three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. The assessments in this section support text answers and multiple-choice questions.

3. **Microsoft Office Section**: This section focuses on assessing candidates' proficiency in Microsoft Office applications. It covers commonly used tools such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Like the other sections, it also offers three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. The assessments in this section support text answers and multiple-choice questions.

## Application Structure

The application consists of two main sections:

1. **Management Section**: This section is dedicated to administrators and managers. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing assessments, difficulty levels, questions, and candidate results. Administrators can create new assessments, set the difficulty levels, add and edit questions, and review candidate performance.

2. **Candidate Section**: This section is designed for candidates to access and complete assessments. Candidates can log in to the platform, select the desired section, and choose the difficulty level they wish to attempt. They can then proceed with the assessment, answer questions (both text answers and multiple-choice questions), and submit their responses.

## Usage

1. Set up the Laravel application environment by installing the necessary dependencies and configuring the database connection.

2. Run database migrations and seed initial data, including assessments, questions, and difficulty levels.

3. Configure user roles and permissions for the management section to control access and functionality for administrators.

4. Deploy the application to a web server or a local development environment.

5. Access the management section to create and manage assessments, questions, and difficulty levels.

6. Candidates can access the candidate section, create an account, and select the desired assessment section and difficulty level to begin the assessment.

7. Review candidate assessment results in the management section, analyze performance, and generate reports as needed.
